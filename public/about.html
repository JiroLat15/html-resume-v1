<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>An Aspiring Full Stack Web Developer with beginners foundation in HTML who seeks to improve and learn more about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

<p>I am a technically adept professional with a deep passion for hardware, video production, and streaming. From a young age, 
    I have honed my skills in building and repairing PCs, laptops, phones, and consoles, making me highly proficient in diagnosing 
    and resolving a wide range of technical issues. My experience extends to videography and storyboard creation, where I combine 
    creativity with technical expertise to produce compelling visual content. Additionally, I have a strong interest in streaming, 
    where I leverage my technical skills to deliver engaging and high-quality broadcasts.</p>

<p>Outside of my professional pursuits, I have been fascinated by technology since I was 12 years old, constantly exploring new ways 
    to enhance and repair hardware. Music is another passion of mine, and while I have dabbled in music production, my primary focus 
    remains on the technical and creative aspects of my work. Even though I am heavily inclined in hardware and creativity, 
    I am committed to continuing my growth in the programming fields, always seeking new challenges and opportunities to apply my skills.</p>
